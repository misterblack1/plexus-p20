-1
"not an SCCS file"
A file that you think is an SCCS file
does not begin with the characters "s.".
-3
"more than one link"
SCCS files may only have one name (link).
This is because the delta program unlinks the old file
and then links to the new file.
-4
"format error at line ..."

FIRST OF ALL, ARE YOU SURE THAT THE NAMED FILE IS A RELEASE 4 SCCS FILE?
(see PIB 77-05).

The format of the SCCS file is logically invalid.  The error
was discovered at the stated line.  See if you can
find the problem with the prs command.  If not, do a "help stuck".
-5
"premature eof"
The SCCS file ended in a strange place.  Its probably a goner.
You can try "help stuck", but chances are you're going to
have to go to a backup copy.
-6
"corrupted file"
The computed hash count of the input SCCS file did not check with the
stored hash count.  The file may have been damaged since it was last
accessed.  See your local SCCS maintenance person.
-7
"too long"
The pathname is too long.
-8
"invalid sid"
The specified sid is syntactically incorrect.
-10
"clock set wrong!!!"
The time of day is wrong.  Contact your local UNIX support group immediately!
(Try a "date" command.)
(This error is produced whenever the creation date of the newest delta
in the SCCS file is newer than the current date.  This will happen
whenever the date is accidently set wrong.  This error
will also occur if a delta was created while the clock was
set ahead - but less than a year - and has since been corrected.
In this case the current time is correct, but the date of the
delta is wrong.)
-11
"Clock may be set wrong!"
The time of day may be set wrong.
Check the current time with the "date" command.
If it is wrong, contact your local UNIX support group immediately!
(This message is produced whenever the difference between
the current date and the creation date of the newest delta in
the SCCS file is greater than one year.)
-12
"bad range"
In a delta list, the two limits of a range of deltas were not in ascending
order.
-13
"delta list syntax"
A list of deltas was syntatically erroneous.  The correct syntax is:
		<list>	::=  <range> | <list> , <range>
		<range>	::=  <delta> | <delta> - <delta>
		<delta>	::=  <rel> | <rel> . <lev>
-14
"not authorized to make deltas"
Your login name or group ID is not on the list of
users who are allowed to add deltas to this file.
You can execute "prs -d:UN: file" to see who is allowed. 
See your project administrator to get your login name or
group ID on the list.
-15
"release ... < ... (floor)"
Either the release you specified or else the default release is lower
than the lowest allowable release (the floor).  If you're not sure what's
wrong see your SCCS administrator.
-16
"release ... > ... (ceiling)"
Either the release you specified or else the default release is higher
than the highest allowable release (the ceiling).  If you're not sure what's
wrong see your SCCS administrator.
-17
"bad p-file format"
The p-file is messed up.
Get your local source code administrator to
fix it.
-18
"line too long"
Don't type so much on a line.
-19
"response too long"
A response can't be so long.
Try typing less (maybe you can reference
some other document).
-20
"cannot fork; try again"
The system is busy;
you'll have to try again later.
-21
"too many MRs"
You can't enter so many MRs.
Sorry.
-22
"out of space"
Your MRs took up too much memory.
Type less.
-23
... locked against editing
The specified release (or possibly all releases) for the
SCCS file have been locked using the _l flag of admin.  Do a
'prs -d:LK: s.filename' to see a list of locked releases
(_a means "all").
