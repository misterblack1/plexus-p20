First, if you know the value of the system error number (errno),
you can either look up a description of it in INTRO(II), or execute
"help err<number>" (e.g., if the error number is 1 execute "help err1").
If you don't know the error number, or you don't understand what's going on -
Try the following, in order:
1. Make sure the answer isn't in the documentation.
2. Try to write(I) to anyone logged in as "adm".
3. Contact your PWB/UNIX counsellor.
4. File an MR (see System Administrator for instructions).
